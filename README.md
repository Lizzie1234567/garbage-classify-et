# garbage-classify-et
The system includes a front-end garbage sorting WeChat Mini Program used by residents and a back-end management system operated by administrators and operators.
The applet satisfies the needs of residents to inquire about garbage categories and guides to put out garbage through image recognition, voice recognition, and fuzzy search and provides a platform for answering questions with intelligent robots and testing garbage classification knowledge. The Facebook_ResNext101 image recognition and the ResNext network are completed in image recognition. 
The back-end system allows administrators to manage the operation contents of the WeChat Mini Program at any time and save the modification results to the database and update them to the Mini Program page synchronously.
